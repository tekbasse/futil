introduction
------------

File Utility is an OpenACS file utility web-app.
It allows files in scoped directories to be managed in a web-based publishing environment.
It is not tied to vertical web applications, such as OpenACS ecommerce package.

This package is the result of some web administrators showing interest in 
having a file utility to be able to delegate some web page resource management 
to priviledged users.
